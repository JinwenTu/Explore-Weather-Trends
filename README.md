# Explore-Weather-Trends

Summary
In this project, I analyzed local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live (Sydney) to overall global temperature trends. My goal was to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in Sydney. 

To do this, I followed the steps below:

1. Extract the data from the database. I exported the temperature data for the world as well as for Sydney by writing a SQL query.

2. Open up the CSV in Excel.

3. Create a line chart that compares Sydney’s temperatures with the global temperatures. Make sure to plot the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable.

4. Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and Sydney’s averages, as well as overall trends.
